To represent the squares we flip boards and number left to right, top to bottom. Then each indexed square will have an integer representing the piece on that square. 

Moves will be done by iterating until a boundary is hit. A way to simplify this is to add buffer locations for off-board locations. 

Downloaded jquery compressed build: jquery-3.2.1.min.js

Part 3: First definitions for board and pieces.

4: converting between square and file/rank
5: sets up board script, and starts castling definitions
6: corrects colour to color and fixes s typo, starts up process of storing which pieces are left and where they are
7: creates function to generate 32 bit random number for key hashing for storing game history
8: creates board state key initialization
9: creates arrays and methods for interchanging board indexing procedures

FEN = Forsyth-Edwards notation
10: begins set up for inputting and parsing FEN, defines board reset method 
11: sets up the function that parses the FEN string and handles the first part about piece placement.
12: finishes setting up the FEN parse code.
13: puts in board console printing function. 
14: removes some old logging and allows general console FEN printing using JQuery.
15: adds method to update the piece list and transfer to it some of the board reset functionality.
